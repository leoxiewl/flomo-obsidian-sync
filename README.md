# Flomo Sync — Obsidian Plugin

Sync your [Flomo](https://flomoapp.com) memos to Obsidian. Auto-login, tag-based or date-based folders, incremental updates.

## Features

- **One-click login**: Log in to Flomo directly from Obsidian — no manual token copying
- **Full sync**: Fetches all your Flomo memos and converts them to Markdown
- **Flexible folder organization**: Organize memos by Flomo tags (default) or by creation date in a `YYYY/MM/DD` hierarchy
- **Incremental updates**: Detects new, updated, and deleted memos
- **Auto sync**: Optional sync on startup + configurable interval
- **HTML → Markdown**: Converts rich text (bold, italic, highlights, blockquotes, lists, images) to clean Markdown
- **Frontmatter**: Each memo includes YAML frontmatter with date, slug, source, and tags

## How It Works

```
Flomo → Login → Fetch all memos → Convert HTML to Markdown → Write to vault
                                                                ↓
                                                        flomo/
                                                        ├── project/content/
                                                        │   └── 2026-05-01_07-59-23.md
                                                        ├── story/dairy/
                                                        │   └── 2026-04-30_23-15-52.md
                                                        └── _untagged/
                                                            └── ...
```

Each memo becomes a Markdown file named by its creation timestamp. By default, files are organized into folders based on your Flomo tags. A memo with multiple tags is copied to all matching folders.

With **By creation date (YYYY/MM/DD)** enabled, memos are instead stored in a date-based hierarchy under the root folder:

```
flomo/
├── 2026/
│   ├── 05/
│   │   ├── 01/
│   │   │   ├── 2026-05-01_07-59-23.md
│   │   │   └── 2026-05-01_08-12-41.md
│   │   └── 02/
│   │       └── 2026-05-02_09-15-21.md
```

Date mode stores each memo in exactly one file. Flomo tags are still preserved in YAML frontmatter and in the memo content, but they do not affect the physical file path. Untagged and tagged memos are treated the same way.

tags:
  - "project/content"

## Disclosures

> **Network access**: This plugin connects to `flomoapp.com` to fetch your memos. All data is stored locally in your Obsidian vault.
>
> **Unofficial API**: This plugin uses Flomo's internal web API (the same endpoints used by the Flomo web app). It is **not** an official Flomo integration and may break if Flomo changes their API. Use at your own discretion.
>
> **Desktop only**: The auto-login feature requires Electron (Obsidian desktop). This plugin does not work on mobile.
>
> **No tracking**: This plugin does not collect any analytics, telemetry, or personal data.
